Hello everyone

I am forever learning and growing for my own personal advancement. I really do love technology and learning all that I can. I want to create something that no one has thought of yet. As I continue to get a grasp of different programming languages, I will continue to brainstorm on new ideas so that I can use the tech that I learn. Learning Python and .JS right now.
